# AI-ML Projects Portfolio (2025)

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository for AI and Machine Learning projects.

This repository is organized into four major folders, each representing a core area of machine learning:

- **Supervised Learning**  
- **Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Time Series & Forecasting**  
- **NLP & LLM**

Each folder contains end-to-end projects related to its specific category, showcasing my learning journey, implementation skills, and understanding of real-world applications.

Feel free to explore the projects and follow the progress as I continue building this portfolio.
